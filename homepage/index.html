  <h2>Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement</h2>
  
  <p>
    Progessive Enhancement is typically just an act or strategy that mainly focuses on the content of a web page. Nothing more and nothing less. It's where the content
    is put on extremely high emphasis and is the <em>FIRST</em> main focus of web development. From my understanding, the use of progessive enhancement allows for a stronger content
    foundaion that eventually leads to a more stable and organized start of a website.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_enhancement" target="_blank">Link to more info I found on Progessive Enhancement</a>
  </p>
    
  <p>
    There are many key reasons why using the progessive enhancement strategy can be helpful and effective (especially in modern web development). Firstly, since websites
    are built to provide content, the first thing that should be in mind is exactly THAT (just content). Without content, there would be no such thing as a "website". The structure, layout, and amount of 
    information that is being provided to the audience is really important when it comes to modern web development. A website can look appealing, but if the content that is 
    being provided is weak, then the website will also be weak as well. Focusing on the content should always be the first step in developing a web page.

  <h2>Dragon Project Revision and Reflection</h2>
  
  <p>
    This project was quite a challenge for me since I didn't have enough confidence in myself 
    while using CSS. When it comes to visualization, adding details, or positioning I always felt
    like I was lacking since I never really understood a few of the CSS concepts. However, as I continued
    to work on this project, I noticed how I repeatedly experimented with different approaches
    of positioning, coloring, or adding aesthetic details. It soom came to my realization that CSS 
    can be all about trial and error. As you continue to experiment with different approaches, you'll
    eventually be able to find one that fits just right.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Html was where I had little to no trouble. Structuring content, adding data, and keeping things nice 
    and organized is something I've always had confidence in. Since this SpaceX Dragon project provided us
    with a diverse amount of content (data, stats, links), it allowed me to be more flexible and open up more to new ways of structuring.
    I believe that I have a stronger understanding of HTML now that I've dealt with the content that's been
    provided from this project. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If I had the chance to start over, I would've taken more time to brainstorm on different CSS styles and 
    positioning. CSS can be extremely versatile and flexible and there can always be room for improvement especially when styling.
    Some things might've been misaligned and I'm sure I could've worked on the header a little more to fit the aesthetic of the
    whole web page. Overall, I think It wasn't a bad attempt and I know I'll be able to do better next time.
  </p>

  <b>Feedback:</b> My sister suggested that I add some content to the left and right side of my website (the white spaces). I chose not to add these changes
   since they could be used for running ads and promoting content related to the website. I also like to keep it 
   quite minimalistic and I feel like it would be a little overwhelming if text was covering the whole page. My mom on the other hand, suggested that the header
   could definitely be better, but she also said its the color of the background and the positioning of the logo that seems a little off. *I've yet to decide whether or not 
   I should add some changes or not.
